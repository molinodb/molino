* About documents rather than individual pieces of data ([nubs], [nbls])

#### [RDF Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-primer-20040210/)
* "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a language for representing information about resources in the World Wide Web. It is __particularly intended for representing metadata about Web resources__, such as the title, author, and modification date of a Web page, copyright and licensing information about a Web document, or the availability schedule for some shared resource."

#### [What the Semantic Web can represent](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/RDFnot.html)
Tim Berners-Less, September 1998
* "The problem with all such systems (such as KIF) was that they were conceptually or physically centralized. They required link global consistency... To webize KIF or KR in general is, in many ways, the same as to webize hypertext in many ways. Replace identifiers with URIs. Remove any requirement for global consistency. Put in a significant effort into getting critical mass. Sit back"

#### [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/)

* "Solid (derived from "social linked data") is a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized social applications based on Linked Data principles"
* "Solid uses WebID URIs as universal usernames or actor identifiers. Frequently referred to simply as __WebIDs, these URIs form the basis of most other Solid-related technologies__, such as authentication, authorization, access control, user profiles, discovery of user preferences and server capabilities, and more."

#### [S4AC](http://ns.inria.fr/s4ac/v2/s4ac_v2.html)
* "S4AC (Social Semantic SPARQL Security for Access Control) is a __lightweight vocabulary to create fine-grained access control policies for Linked Data__. The vocabulary has the aim to design and share security information specifying the access control conditions under which the data is accessible. Implementations are free to extend S4AC to add further functionalities."

#### [OBDA Systems](http://www.obdasystems.com/) 
"OBDA Systems proposes state-of-the-art solutions based on the most recent innovations in the field of semantic technologies to provide its clients with a direct and effective means for extracting key data from large and complex datasets. The foundation of these solutions is representation and reasoning through ontology modelling."
